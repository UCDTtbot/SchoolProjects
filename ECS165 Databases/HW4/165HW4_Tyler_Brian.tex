\item The Schema for EIA is:\\
EIA\_CO2\_Trans(MSN, YYYYMM, Value)\\
EIA\_CO2\_Elec(MSN, YYYYMM, Value)\\
EIA\_Mkwh(MSN, YYYYMM, Value)\\
Descrip(MSN, Column\_Order, Description, Unit)

MSNs are directly related to Descriptions and can be looked up in the Descrip table. Future updates with the same data can easily be inserted as is. If new columns must be added, the changes must be hard coded.\\

The NHTS data is too long to write out here. The tables and data are identical to the original data set, and no changes were made. No columns were taken out, and any future updates to the data can be handled as it. Any additions in columns are automatically handled through the script.

\item We chose Python 2 as our language. We use the psycopg2 package to handle SQL connection, and the cvs package to parse the data.\\
\textbf{Run:} python2 createTables.py ; to create the tables in the public postgres database for the current user. (Alternatively, createSubsetTables.py can be run to use the subset data.)\\
\textbf{Run:} python2 queries.py ; to run the queries in problem 3. It will take some time to run all queries, but output will be listed below. 
\item The following output is for queries on the NHTS and EIA datasets. These outputs can be recreated by running, python2 queries.py
