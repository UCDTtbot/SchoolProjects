Make file made all 6 tests without fail, FINALLY

Part 1: Works fine. Easy to construct.
Part 2: Works fine, but was the hardest part of this entire assignment, taking about 10 hours of my time throughout the 
		first week of working on it.
Part 3: Works fine, but flatten() at first proved to be quite tricky and took awhile to finish.
Part 4:	Works fine, and was fairly easy to construct.
Part 5: Works fine, was probably the easiest besides part 1.
Part 6: Works fine, and was fairly tricky to work out in a way. Map was easy enough to begin with as long as I just treated
		a Map as a new Sequence. The iterator was trickier and required me to completely start over on it and implement it
		just as a SequenceIterator

NOTE ON CODE COMMENTS:
	For the most part throughout the assignment, I forgot to comment my code. Because of this, comments have been added
	to all files in Part 6. Parts 1-5 will be lacking in comments for the most part.
