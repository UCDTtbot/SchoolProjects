Handin Directions
=================

Please follow these directions *exactly*.

1. Prepare the files that you want to turn in.  Make a new directory,
   say named "HW", then "cd HW".  

   In this HW directory, include a README file indicating what you think
   works and doesn't work for your assignment.  In this file, explain
   any peculiarities in your implementation.  In addition, also includes
   part5 as indicated in the handout.

   Into this HW directory, copy each of the part.  In your HW
   directory, you will have 5 directories: part1, part2, part3, part4,
   and part5.

   If your program does not fully work, turn in the last working part
   along with your attempt at the next part, and indicate this clearly
   in the README file.

   Remove files we don't need by:
 
         make clean

         rm t*.e *.correct *.output run run1 runall showdiffs

         rm any other "junk" files you might have there.

      (But, be sure that what you give us is still complete and working
      as well as it did for you!)


2. In the HW directory, type in the command

      zip -r hw2 *

   This will create a file named hw2.zip containing the directories
   part1 ... part5 and the README file. Now submit this file with

      handin cs140a hw2 hw2.zip

   The name "hw2" is a name the cs140a account uses for this
   assignment.  Be sure to use the exact name "hw2".

3. You can also use handin to make sure your zip file reaches the
   right place:

      handin cs140a hw2

4. If you want to submit your homework for a second time before the
   deadline, feel free to do so, but make sure you hand in everything
   each time. We will not grade you using two parts of two different
   submissions.

5. Remember to submit everything before the deadline, 11:59pm on
   Thursday, January 29, 2015.
